                                camping is sitting around the fire at night. When we’re outdoors, the campfire is where
                                we gather to eat, share stories and lose ourselves under the big starry night sky.</p>

            <h1 class="artical-heading">Mountain Trek</h1>
            <p>A trek is a mirror that reveals our true capabilities. There are many situations where we feel good
                because we fare better than what we thought we would. Then, there are equal if not more number of
                situations where we need to get better. This is how personality development begins from deep within.
            </p>

            <h1 class="artical-heading">Cycling</h1>
            <p>Be it riding over the obstacles, flipping, or performing gravity defying stunts, this trail across the
                ‘roof of the world’ contains all the elements to leave you mesmerized for a very long time. Specially
                curated for thrill-seekers, the Leh-Zanskar bike tour takes the bikers through passes, valleys, and some
                of the narrowest alleys that are not at all easy to ride across. As the tour progresses the difficulty
                level keeps raising the bar, which in turn tests maximum daredevilry.</p>

            <h1 class="artical-heading">Long Treking</h1>
            <p>A trek although offers you an experience like never before; it also expects a trekker to do things he/she
                has never done before. Nothing comes for free on a trek. It gives you the delight of spectacular views;
                but may also deprive you of all the energy you need to celebrate those moments (as you may have done a
                tough climb a whole day to reach these places). Hence, it is not only a vacation but also a learning
                experience. </p>

            <h1 class="artical-heading">Night Camping</h1>
            <p>There may be no better place to catch up with good friends and family than outdoors and sitting around a
                campfire. There’s no email, no Netflix® and no distractions. We relax, unwind and let our guards down a
                bit more around the soft glow of a fire. Because of this, conversations are deeper, stories are funnier
                and you’re guaranteed to learn a few things about the people you’re with that you never knew before. The
                campfire is your entertainment for the evening and there’s nothing else to do but be present in the
                moment and enjoy all of the meaningful connections and deep belly laughs you probably haven’t had in a
                while</p>

            <h1 class="artical-heading">Snow Treking</h1>
            <p>Walking alone in mountains is a great experience. Trails cut between mountains and run by the riverside.
                I get this opportunity mostly in my Himalayan treks. There are miles and miles of mountains in front of
                us and miles behind us. A trek in the snow offers an adventurous journey, chilling climate, and lots of
                extraordinary places to explore. We are gifted with countless places of natural beauty to see. Nature
                remains a hidden treasure so long as mankind does not disturb it. Let us explore lots of mesmerizing
                places, challenge our capabilities, and embrace the nature. </p>
