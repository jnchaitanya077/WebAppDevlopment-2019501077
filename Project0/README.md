# Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Website I have created in project0 is **Trekking Club Website**.

Whole website contains four pages.

1. index.html
2. adventure.html
3. Packages.html
4. contact.html


I have used **HTML, CSS** and **bootstrap framework**.

### index.html
First page index.html is the main homepage of the website and it contains information related to trekking club.
I made use of different css properties to look good and responsive.

### adventure.html
This is the second page in my website. It contains different information about different things can do in joining
trekking club. In this page I used bootstrap components like cards. This page is mobile responsive also.

### packages.html
This page contains top and popular treks information. In this page I used bootstrap carousel for displaying images in slide show. I also used the
bootstrap tables for displaying information and its mobiles responsive.

### contact.html
This page contains a form asking user details to join their trekking club.

In every page responsive navigation bar is present at the top of the site which gives the user to navigate pages from present page to any other page. And style-sheets are written is Sass and compiled to produce .css files.
